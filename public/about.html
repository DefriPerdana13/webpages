    Kereta Api Indonesia is the latest of a long line of successive state railway companies dating from Dutch colonial days. On August 27, 1863, Indonesia's first railway company was named Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij (NIS). The colonial government of Dutch-East Indies gave the concession to W. Poolman, Alex Frazer and E.H. Kol on August 28, 1862. Samarang-Tanggung (Grobogan) was its initial route. The ground breaking was in Kemijen village, Semarang by L.A.J.W. Baron Sloet van de Beele on June 17, 1864. The line opened on August 10, 1867[7][8] was Batavia (Jakarta) – Buitenzorg (Bogor) and Samarang – Vorstenlanden (Surakarta and Yogyakarta). They faced big losses and faced bankruptcy. The colonial government assisted the company by forming Staatsspoorwegen, a state-owned company on April 6, 1875. Their route stretched from Buitenzorg to Soerabaja. The government established Deli Spoorweg Maatschappij in North Sumatra, to transport rubber and tobacco around the Deli area.</p>
